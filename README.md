# Github Must Be a Free Platform

![alt text](./message.png)

## Introduction

Github has been a free platform for everyone since many years ago. But recently, it decided to restrict **Iranian accounts**.
We believe living in a country is not a choice, but being a developer and contributing to the open-source community is.
Github has restricted our freedom to contribute and to be a part of the open-source ecosystem, because we live in Iran.

**Github blocked our private repositories without warning us, and now we have no access to our codes.**

We believe having a **simple Github page** is a basic right for all users. 
Please don't make us leave the open-source community.
